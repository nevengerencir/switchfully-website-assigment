            "Hello there! I'm a 27-year-old introvert hailing from the beautiful country of Croatia, but currently finding my way in the charming city of Antwerp. <br> While I thrive in my solitary moments, I've surprisingly discovered a knack for being active with people, cherishing moments spent over engaging conversations and shared experiences.
            <br>My passions are quite diverse. <br>On one hand, I'm an avid fan of RPG and board games, with Dominion reigning as my ultimate favorite in the board game realm, and Skyrim whisking me away into its fantastical universe whenever I get the chance. <br>On the other hand, I have a love for sports that keeps me grounded and energized.<br>
            When I'm not immersed in gaming or staying active, you might find me enjoying the epic adventures of the 'Lord of the Rings' movie series, which holds a special place in my heart. 
            <br>Life for me is a blend of introspective moments and vibrant interactions, a balance that keeps me engaged and intrigued every step of the way."
